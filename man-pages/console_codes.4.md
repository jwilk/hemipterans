> Normal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24)

This is weird. Why single out this particular version?

I thought maybe it's meant to say “not implemented *as of* Linux 2.0.24”),
but AFAICS it was actually implemented much earlier, in
[1.1.35](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/?id=f48455d2222abd02d9a3b4e98096bb7f05045779).

OTOH, in <https://github.com/telmich/gpm/issues/29>, Egmont Koblinger wrote:

So I'm confused.

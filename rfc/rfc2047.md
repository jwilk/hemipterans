[RFC 2047 §6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2047#section-6.2) reads:

> It is […]
> possible to hide 'special' characters in encoded-words which, when
> displayed, will be indistinguishable from 'special' characters in the
> surrounding text.  For this and other reasons, it is NOT generally
> possible to translate a message header containing 'encoded-word's to
> an unencoded form which can be parsed by an RFC 822 mail reader.

That doesn't sound right.
